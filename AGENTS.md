## About me

- My name is Leo. I'm a frontend developer based in Brasov, Romania.
- My GitHub username is `leonistor` and my email is `leo.nistor@gmail.com`.
- I primarily work in TypeScript and Python.

## Communication

- Keep responses concise and to the point - unless the user asks otherwise
- Add doc comments to the code, explain in comments design decisions or tricky stuff

## Working with Git

- Always use semantic commit prefixes (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.).
- Push to a feature branch when more than 5 files are planned to be added or changed, othewise commit on main
- Run the project's lint script before committing, if one exists.
- Never commit, push, or open a PR unless asked.

## Planning mode

- Always ask clarifying questions
- Use deep-dive sub-agents to assist with research
- Use deep-dive sub-agents to review the different aspects of your plan before presenting to the user

## Code style

- Follow the patterns already in neighboring files.
- Do not add comments that restate the code.
- Do not reformat code you are not otherwise changing.

## Change / edit mode

- Never implement features yourself when possible - use sub-agents!
- Identify changes from the plan that can be implemented in parallel, and use sub-agents to implement the features efficiently
- When using sub-agents to implement features, act as a coordinator only
- Use the best model for the task - premium models for complex tasks (like coding) and mid-tier models for simpler tasks, like documentation
- After completing features (large or small), always run commands like lint, type check and next build to check code quality

## Boundaries

- Do not modify unrelated files or widen scope beyond the request without asking permission.
- Do not add dependencies without asking.
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or .env files.
- If a command fails, report the failure. Do not guess or present assumptions as confirmed results.

## Testing

- Use any testing tools, libraries available to the project for testing your changes
- Never assume your changes simply work, always test!
- If the project does not have any testing tools, scripts, MCP tools, skills, etc. available for testing, ask the user whether testing should be skipped.

## UI design

- Always follow the UI design system when creating or reviewing components or pages.
- Design System: @DESIGN.md

### Python workflow

- **Standards:** @~/.config/opencode/docs/index.md (Python, Docker, tooling)
- **Packages:** @~/.config/opencode/docs/tooling/package-management.md (`uv`)
- **Testing:** @~/.config/opencode/docs/python/testing.md (`pytest`, coverage)

## Skills - Knowledge Injection

Skills are reusable knowledge packages. Load them on-demand for specialized tasks.

### When to Use

- Before unfamiliar work - check if a skill exists
- When you need domain-specific patterns
- For complex workflows that benefit from guidance

### Usage

```bash
skills_list()                              # See available skills
skills_use(name="swarm-coordination")      # Load a skill
skills_use(name="cli-builder", context="building a new CLI") # With context
```

**Bundled Skills:** cli-builder, learning-systems, skill-creator, swarm-coordination, system-design, testing-patterns

## Hivemind - Unified Memory System

The hive remembers everything. Learnings, sessions, patterns—all searchable.

**Unified storage:** Manual learnings and AI agent session histories stored in the same database, searchable together. Powered by libSQL vectors + Ollama embeddings.

**Indexed agents:** Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Aider, ChatGPT, Cline, OpenCode, Amp, Pi-Agent

### When to Use

- **BEFORE implementing** - check if you or any agent solved it before
- **After solving hard problems** - store learnings for future sessions
- **Debugging** - search past sessions for similar errors
- **Architecture decisions** - record reasoning, alternatives, tradeoffs
- **Project-specific patterns** - capture domain rules and gotchas

### Tools

| Tool                | Purpose                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hivemind_store`    | Store a memory (learnings, decisions, patterns)                     |
| `hivemind_find`     | Search all memories (learnings + sessions, semantic + FTS fallback) |
| `hivemind_get`      | Get specific memory by ID                                           |
| `hivemind_remove`   | Delete outdated/incorrect memory                                    |
| `hivemind_validate` | Confirm memory still accurate (resets 90-day decay timer)           |
| `hivemind_stats`    | Memory statistics and health check                                  |
| `hivemind_index`    | Index AI session directories                                        |
| `hivemind_sync`     | Sync to .hive/memories.jsonl (git-backed, team-shared)              |

### Usage

**Store a learning** (include WHY, not just WHAT):

```typescript
hivemind_store({
  information:
    "OAuth refresh tokens need 5min buffer before expiry to avoid race conditions. Without buffer, token refresh can fail mid-request if expiry happens between check and use.",
  tags: "auth,oauth,tokens,race-conditions",
});
```

**Search all memories** (learnings + sessions):

```typescript
// Search everything
hivemind_find({ query: "token refresh", limit: 5 });

// Search only learnings (manual entries)
hivemind_find({ query: "authentication", collection: "default" });

// Search only Claude sessions
hivemind_find({ query: "Next.js caching", collection: "claude" });

// Search only Cursor sessions
hivemind_find({ query: "API design", collection: "cursor" });
```

**Get specific memory**:

```typescript
hivemind_get({ id: "mem_xyz123" });
```

**Delete outdated memory**:

```typescript
hivemind_remove({ id: "mem_old456" });
```

**Validate memory is still accurate** (resets decay):

```typescript
// Confirmed this memory is still relevant
hivemind_validate({ id: "mem_xyz123" });
```

**Index new sessions**:

```typescript
// Automatically indexes ~/.config/opencode/sessions, ~/.cursor-tutor, etc.
hivemind_index();
```

**Sync to git**:

```typescript
// Writes learnings to .hive/memories.jsonl for git sync
hivemind_sync();
```

**Check stats**:

```typescript
hivemind_stats();
```

### Usage Pattern

```bash
# 1. Before starting work - query for relevant learnings
hivemind_find({ query: "<task keywords>", limit: 5 })

# 2. Do the work...

# 3. After solving hard problem - store learning
hivemind_store({
  information: "<what you learned, WHY it matters>",
  tags: "<relevant,tags>"
})

# 4. Validate memories when you confirm they're still accurate
hivemind_validate({ id: "<memory-id>" })
```

### Integration with Workflow

**At task start** (query BEFORE implementing):

```bash
# Check if you or any agent solved similar problems
hivemind_find({ query: "OAuth token refresh buffer", limit: 5 })
```

**During debugging** (search past sessions):

```bash
# Find similar errors from past sessions
hivemind_find({ query: "cannot read property of undefined", collection: "claude" })
```

**After solving problems** (store learnings):

```bash
# Store root cause + solution, not just "fixed it"
hivemind_store({
  information: "Next.js searchParams causes dynamic rendering. Workaround: destructure in parent, pass as props to cached child.",
  tags: "nextjs,cache-components,dynamic-rendering,searchparams"
})
```

**Learning from other agents**:

```bash
# See how Cursor handled similar feature
hivemind_find({ query: "implement authentication", collection: "cursor" })
```

**Pro tip:** Query Hivemind at the START of complex tasks. Past solutions (yours or other agents') save time and prevent reinventing wheels.

## Swarm Coordinator Checklist (MANDATORY)

When coordinating a swarm, you MUST monitor workers and review their output.

### Monitor Loop

### Review Tools

| Tool                    | Purpose                                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `swarm_review`          | Generate review prompt with epic context, dependencies, and git diff |
| `swarm_review_feedback` | Send approval/rejection to worker (tracks 3-strike rule)             |

### Review Criteria

- Does work fulfill subtask requirements?
- Does it serve the overall epic goal?
- Does it enable downstream tasks?
- Type safety, no obvious bugs?

### 3-Strike Rule

After 3 review rejections, task is marked **blocked**. This signals an architectural problem, not "try harder."

**NEVER skip the review step.** Workers complete faster when they get feedback.
